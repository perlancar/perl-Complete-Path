Revision history for Complete-Path

0.02    2014-12-25 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Tweak regex so that things still work if list_func
	  returns items suffixed by path separator (like the case in
	  Complete::Module).


0.01    2014-12-24 (PERLANCAR) - â™ª another year has gone by

        - First release. Refactored from Complete::Util's complete_file() to
          avoid code duplication, as the functionality is also needed in
          Complete::Module, Complete::Riap, and others in the future whenever we
          need ci/exp_im_path/map_case/... options when completing anything
          path-like.
