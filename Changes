0.251   2021-02-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- Add options: recurse_matching, exclude_leaf, exclude_dir.


0.250   2021-02-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

	- [experimental] Add experimental option: recurse.


0.24    2017-07-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - No functional changes.

        - Bump prereq versions, remove usage of Log::Any.


0.23    2016-06-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Finding exact match of an intermediate path was still
	  wrong: first the result from list_func has path separator suffix
	  and we compare it with the string without, second due to fuzzy
	  matching we cannot rely on length() alone but must use eq.

	- [Bugfix] EXP_IM_PATH=0 option was not respected.


0.22    2016-04-13  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Fix calculating exact matches (which caused e.g.
	  f/bar<tab> to fail matching f directly when there is f and foo).

        - Observe COMPLETE_PATH_TRACE to enable extra logging for debugging.


0.21    2016-01-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] dig_leaf option should still respect filter.


0.20    2015-11-29  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Adjust to Complete::Common 0.21

        - [Removed] For more consistent user experience, remove options
	  ci/word_mode/fuzzy/map_case/exp_im_path/dig_leaf, users are now
	  encouraged to set this behavior globally via Complete::Common.


0.19    2015-09-22  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Avoid error when list_func doesn't return array.

	- Update documentation.


0.18    2015-09-17  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add fuzzy matching, use Complete::Util::complete_array_elem's
	  map_case (+ci, +fuzzy) instead of doing our own.


0.17    2015-09-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No longer uses $Complete::Setting::OPT_EXP_IM_PATH_MAX_LEN.


0.16    2015-09-16  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Fix exact match matching for intermediate path (missed
	  the path separator).


0.15    2015-09-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Tweak exp_im_path behavior: if a single exact match of an
	  intermediate dir is found, don't expand all alternatives but
	  instead of just that exact match. This is the desired behavior
	  most of the time.


0.14    2015-09-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to
	  DevelopRecommends to reduce deps but still allow indicating spec
	  requirement.


0.13    2015-09-03  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to
	  DevelopRecommends to reduce deps but still allow indicating spec
	  requirement.


0.12    2015-01-09  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Implement dig_leaf option (Complete 0.11).


0.09    2015-01-08  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] needed to use label to exit loop due to added block
	  level (broke Complete::File test) [CT].


0.08    2015-01-07  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Add convenience of locally setting $_ for filter_func/is_dir_func
	  routine.


0.07    2015-01-02  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] Perform is_dir_func test on the original path, not the
	  postprocessed one.


0.06    2014-12-27  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- Adjust to Complete 0.10, respect OPT_EXP_IM_PATH_MAX_LEN setting.


0.05    2014-12-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [doc] More explanation about 'list_func', 'filter_func',
	  'is_dir_func'.

	- No functional changes.

	- Derp, forgot to comment-out debugging prints.


0.03    2014-12-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Cut too much if starting_path ends with path_sep.


0.02    2014-12-25  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Tweak regex so that things still work if list_func
	  returns items suffixed by path separator (like the case in
	  Complete::Module).


0.01    2014-12-24  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Note: â™ª another year has gone by

        - First release. Refactored from Complete::Util's complete_file() to
          avoid code duplication, as the functionality is also needed in
          Complete::Module, Complete::Riap, and others in the future whenever we
          need ci/exp_im_path/map_case/... options when completing anything
          path-like.
