Revision history for Complete-Path

0.20    2015-11-29 (PERLANCAR)

	- Adjust to Complete::Common 0.21; [Removed] For more consistent
	  user experience, remove options
	  ci/word_mode/fuzzy/map_case/exp_im_path/dig_leaf, users are now
	  encouraged to set this behavior globally via Complete::Common.


0.19    2015-09-22 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Avoid error when list_func doesn't return array.

	- Update documentation.


0.18    2015-09-17 (PERLANCAR)

	- Add fuzzy matching, use Complete::Util::complete_array_elem's
	  map_case (+ci, +fuzzy) instead of doing our own.


0.17    2015-09-16 (PERLANCAR)

	- No longer uses $Complete::Setting::OPT_EXP_IM_PATH_MAX_LEN.


0.16    2015-09-16 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Fix exact match matching for intermediate path (missed
	  the path separator).


0.15    2015-09-09 (PERLANCAR)

	- Tweak exp_im_path behavior: if a single exact match of an
	  intermediate dir is found, don't expand all alternatives but
	  instead of just that exact match. This is the desired behavior
	  most of the time.


0.14    2015-09-09 (PERLANCAR)

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to
	  DevelopRecommends to reduce deps but still allow indicating spec
	  requirement.

	- No functional changes.

	- [dist] Move spec prereqs from RuntimeRequires to

	  routine.

0.02    2014-12-25 (PERLANCAR)

	- [Bugfix] Tweak regex so that things still work if list_func
	  returns items suffixed by path separator (like the case in
	  Complete::Module).


0.01    2014-12-24 (PERLANCAR) - â™ª another year has gone by

        - First release. Refactored from Complete::Util's complete_file() to
          avoid code duplication, as the functionality is also needed in
          Complete::Module, Complete::Riap, and others in the future whenever we
          need ci/exp_im_path/map_case/... options when completing anything
          path-like.
